# Build a cross-chain NFT

An NFT collection with cross-chain transfer capabilities using [Zeta Connector](/developers/cross-chain-messaging/connector.mdx).

To create a cross-chain NFT collection you will need to deploy NFT contracts implementing Zeta's interfaces and functions to multiple chains.

In a nutshell, your contracts will need to:

- Implement a `crossChainTransfer` function, that burns the NFT on the current chain and uses `zeta.send` to send a message that mints it on the other one.
- Implement `onZetaMessage` to mint the NFT that was burned on the other chain.
- Implement `onZetaRevert` to handle `crossChainTransfer` errors, and re-mint the previously burned NFT.

Here's a code example:

```

To see a tested, working implementation and try it in testnet, check our [examples package](https://github.com/zeta-chain/zetachain/tree/main/packages/example-contracts).
