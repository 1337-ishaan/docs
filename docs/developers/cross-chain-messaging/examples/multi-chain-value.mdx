# Multichain Value Transfer

This is an example contract that shows how you can send value across chains via the ZetaChain API.

From this rudimentary example, you could easily extend it to support arbitrary asset exchanges via a swap to/from ZETA on source and destination.

```

To see a tested, working implementation and try it in testnet, check our [examples package](https://github.com/zeta-chain/zetachain/tree/main/packages/example-contracts).
